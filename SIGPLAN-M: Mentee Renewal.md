Hi all,

All of you have matches with mentors that are close to or past the year mark. **Now is the time to renew your spot as a mentee in SIGPLAN-M**. You have three choices:

1. **To renew your relationship with the same mentor, please [fill out this form](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://forms.gle/r1JdE5PKHzzHdjET7__;!!DZ3fjg!7GDL-c184J2ZFpujv6XkQP2g5TiiyElu8m1kBX51P8TIqWc91310MpzELocvoUPIlRDvyHZsPQiizJ5FcuJTpT_F$) and list your current mentor** as the answer to the question "Do you have a preferred mentor?"

2. **To rematch with a new mentor**, please also [fill out this form](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://forms.gle/r1JdE5PKHzzHdjET7__;!!DZ3fjg!7GDL-c184J2ZFpujv6XkQP2g5TiiyElu8m1kBX51P8TIqWc91310MpzELocvoUPIlRDvyHZsPQiizJ5FcuJTpT_F$), but either leave that question blank or list another mentor you'd prefer to match with.

3. **To give up your spot as a mentee in SIGPLAN-M**, please do nothing---this is the default action!

If you list your mentor as a preferred mentor, and your mentor also lists you as a preferred mentee, you will continue for another year with your mentor by default. If the match is not mutual, we will work it out individually---this can happen and does not reflect at all on you, since sometimes mentors just get really, really busy and realize they have overcommitted. Likewise, please don't worry about offending your mentor by not requesting them; they will understand, and we will take care of it.

**Please take one of these actions in the next week or so**. I will check in again at least once before taking any further action.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
