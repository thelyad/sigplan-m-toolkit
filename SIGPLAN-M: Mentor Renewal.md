Hi [FirstName],

Hope you're doing well! Thanks again for volunteering! Some of your matches (in bold) are close to the year mark and up for renewal:

**Now is the time to renew your spot as a mentor in SIGPLAN-M**. You have four choices:

1. **To renew your relationship with the same mentee(s)**, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/aer7Uc5CHohH6fZY6) and list your current mentee(s) as the answer to the question "Do you have preferred mentee(s)?"
2. **To rematch with new mentee(s)**, please also [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/aer7Uc5CHohH6fZY6), but either leave that question blank or list other mentees you'd prefer to match with.
3. **To automatically drop all mentees with whom your relationship has already hit the year mark**, but keep the rest of your mentees, please do nothing---this is the default action!
4. **To drop out of the program as a mentor entirely**, please respond to this email and tell me.

If you have recently filled out the form and nothing has since changed, it is okay to leave some questions blank or just say you've recently filled out the form and let me know your preferences. We will handle any mismatches in preferences, and will be in touch regardless.

**Please take one of these actions in the next week or so**. I will check in again at least once before taking any further action.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
